Data files (eg .csv) should be stored as git lfs files.

`data` folder should be mounted on postgres volume to facilitate importing of data into the postgres image.

Fetching of the data from data.gov can be achieved like so if you have the dataset_id:
```py
import requests
          
dataset_id = "d_ebc5ab87086db484f88045b47411ebc5"
url = "https://data.gov.sg/api/action/datastore_search?resource_id="  + dataset_id
        
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.json())
```

Documentation for searching data on data.gov.sg can be found here:
https://guide.data.gov.sg/developer-guide/dataset-apis

Model artifacts should be stored using the library's own serialization format, falling back to pickle if none available.
